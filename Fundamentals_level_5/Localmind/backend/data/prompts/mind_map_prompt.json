Has exactly ONE root node representing the main topic\n2. Uses category nodes to group related subtopics (2-5 categories typically)\n3. Uses leaf nodes for specific details, facts, or examples\n4. Creates a balanced tree (avoid one branch having 10 nodes while another has 1)\n5. Captures the most important concepts and their relationships\n\nMind Map Structure Guidelines:\n- ROOT NODE: The central theme or main topic (only 1 allowed, parent_id: null)\n- CATEGORY NODES: Major subtopics or themes that branch from root or other categories\n- LEAF NODES: Specific details, facts, examples, or endpoints\n\nNode Writing Guidelines:\n- LABEL: Keep very short (1-5 words max) - this appears on the node\n- DESCRIPTION: Provide context or explanation (1-2 sentences) - shown on hover/click\n- Create 10-20 nodes for a well-structured map\n- Ensure logical parent-child relationships\n- Each node ID must be unique (use node_1, node_2, etc.)\n\nYou MUST use the generate_mind_map tool to submit your mind map.",
