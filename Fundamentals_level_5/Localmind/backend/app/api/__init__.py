API Blueprint initialization.

Educational Note: Blueprints help organize Flask applications by
grouping related routes together. This makes the code more modular
and easier to maintain.

# Educational Note: The noqa comment tells flake8 to ignore the
# "imported but unused" warning. We import to register routes,
# not to use the module directly.
