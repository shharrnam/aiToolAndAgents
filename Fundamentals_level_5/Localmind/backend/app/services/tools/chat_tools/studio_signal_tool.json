  "description": "Activate studio generation options based on conversation context. Use this tool GENEROUSLY - when you identify a context, activate ALL relevant items for that context, not just one.\n\nThe studio panel shows generation options that start inactive. When you identify opportunities where the user could benefit from generated content, activate the relevant studio items.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT tell the user you're activating signals. Let the studio panel feel contextually aware and self-evolving.\n\nACTIVATE GENEROUSLY - When context is identified, activate ALL relevant items:\n\nLEARNING CONTEXT (any educational discussion, explaining concepts, studying):\n→ Activate ALL: quiz, flash_cards, audio_overview, mind_map\n- User learning anything, being taught, studying, understanding concepts\n- Explained something in simple terms? Activate learning signals!\n\nBUSINESS & PRODUCT CONTEXT (any business data, metrics, analysis, product work, design):\n→ Activate ALL: business_report, marketing_strategy, prd, infographics, flow_diagram, wireframes, presentation\n- User analyzing data, discussing business metrics, looking at trends\n- Any CSV analysis, sales data, customer data? Activate business signals!\n- Working on product requirements or specs? Activate prd!\n- Need visual data storytelling? Activate infographics!\n- Discussing processes, workflows, or system architecture? Activate flow_diagram!\n- Planning UI/UX, screen layouts, or design mockups? Activate wireframes! - Preparing pitch decks, slide presentations, or investor materials? Activate presentation!\n\nCONTENT CONTEXT (any content creation, marketing materials):\n→ Activate ALL: blog, social, website, email_templates, components, ads_creative, video\n- User working on content, marketing materials, web pages\n- Discussing features, benefits, audiences? Activate content signals!\n- Need email campaigns, UI components, or ad creatives? Activate those too! - Creating video content, YouTube scripts, or storyboards? Activate video!\n\nBe proactive - if the conversation has ANY learning, business, or content aspect, activate the relevant group of signals. Better to give users options than to miss opportunities.",
