Source Upload Module - Handles different types of source uploads.

Educational Note: Upload logic is separated by type for cleaner code:
- file_upload: File uploads (PDF, DOCX, images, audio, etc.)
- url_upload: URL sources (websites, YouTube links)
- text_upload: Pasted text content
- research_upload: Deep research sources (AI agent researched topics)
