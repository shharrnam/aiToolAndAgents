AI Agents - Complex AI agents with agentic loops.

Educational Note: This folder contains AI agents that use tool loops
and multiple API calls to complete complex tasks. Unlike ai_services
(single API call), these agents iterate until a termination condition.

Agents:
- web_agent_service: Extracts content from URLs using web tools
  - Uses agentic loop with MAX_ITERATIONS limit
  - Tools: web_fetch, web_search, tavily_search, return_search_result
  - Saves execution logs for debugging

- email_agent_service: Generates HTML email templates
  - Uses agentic loop with MAX_ITERATIONS limit (15)
  - Tools: plan_email_template, generate_email_image, write_email_code
  - Orchestrates planning → image generation → HTML code writing

- website_agent_service: Generates complete websites (HTML/CSS/JS)
  - Uses agentic loop with MAX_ITERATIONS limit (30)
  - Tools: plan_website, generate_website_image, read_file, create_file,
    update_file_lines, insert_code, finalize_website
  - Orchestrates planning → image generation → iterative file creation/editing

Key patterns:
- Agent loop with iteration limit
- Tool executor for routing tool calls
- Termination tool to signal completion
- Execution logging for debugging
