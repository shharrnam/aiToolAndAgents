"""
Data Services - CRUD operations for data entities.

Educational Note: This folder contains services that manage data persistence
and entity lifecycle. These are NOT AI-powered services - they handle
reading, writing, and organizing data stored in JSON files.

Services:
- chat_service: Chat CRUD operations (create, list, get, update, delete)
- project_service: Project CRUD operations and settings management
- message_service: Message persistence, context building, and tool response parsing

These services typically:
- Work with JSON files for persistence
- Handle entity metadata and relationships
- Provide index management for efficient lookups
