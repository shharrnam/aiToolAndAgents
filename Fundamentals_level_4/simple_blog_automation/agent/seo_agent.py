                            • Be specific and descriptive (e.g., "a golden retriever sitting on a beach at sunset" not just "dog")
                            • Specify artistic style (e.g., "photorealistic", "watercolor painting", "3D render", "flat illustration")
                            • Include composition details (e.g., "wide-angle shot", "close-up", "aerial view")
                            • Describe lighting and atmosphere (e.g., "soft morning light", "dramatic shadows", "bright and airy")
